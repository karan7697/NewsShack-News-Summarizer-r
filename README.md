# NewsShack-News-Summarizer
News Summarizer using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

Today, users are shifting from consuming news on traditional platforms like television and print
media to digital news platforms and social media. As the amount of news available on digital
platforms is increasing rapidly, summarization of news has become essential. News summary
presents the users with easy-to-understand text while maintaining the context of the information,
and this allows users to read the news and understand the context of the situation in a short
duration. In this work, we have built an abstractive news summarization application on Streamlit
using a fine-tuned T5 transformer model. The T5 transformer model has been fine-tuned on the
CNN-Dailymail dataset which contains more than 300K news articles and their summaries
before developing the summarization application.
